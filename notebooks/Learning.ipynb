    "When learning a model $M$, our quantitative measure of how well it explains the data $D$ is the evidence $P(D\\mid M)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since unsupervised and supervised learning requires first learning the model, we could use the same measure, but a different measure is also useful: how well does $M$ explain unobserved data $D'$?  In other words, how well does the learned model generalize and offer predictive power?  In order to answer this question, in practice, you must hold back some of your observed data when learning the model and can then measure how well the model \"postdicts\" the held back data. The held back data is referred to as the **test sample** and this process is known as **cross validation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the model and its parameters have some physical reality (for example, projectile motion modeled with Newtonian physics and parameterized by $g$, ...), these measures are essentially the same since the model is dictated by some independent reality and not chosen specifically to explain the observed data $D$.\n",

    "However, when predicting future data is the main goal and there is no first-principles model available, the model and its parameters are essentially unconstrained and these two measures can easily diverge.
