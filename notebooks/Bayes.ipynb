If you randomly select items and read their serial numbers, the problem of estimating $N$ is analogous to our dice problem, but with many more models to consider.

    " - The posterior now peaks away from the mean observed pass rate of 1/2.  This is reasonable if we believe our prior information since, with relatively uninformative data, Bayes' rule tells us that it should dominate our knowledge of $\\theta$.  On the other hand, if we cannot justify why this prior is more believable than the earlier flat prior, then we must conclude that the value of $\\theta$ is unknown and that our data has not helped.\n",
    " - If a previous experiment with 13 observations found 4 passing, then our new prior would be very reasonable. However, if this process has never been observed and we have no theoretical prejudice, then the original flat prior would be reasonable."

    " - With more data, the prior has much less influence. This is always the regime you want to be in.\n",

    "You are hopefully convinced now that your choice of priors is mostly a non issue, since inference with good data is relatively insensitive to your choice.  However, you still need to make a choice, so here are some practical guidelines:\n",
    " - A \"missing\" prior, $P(\\Theta\\mid M) = 1$, is still a prior but not necessarily a \"natural\" choice or a \"safe default\". It is often not even normalizable, although you can finesse this problem with good enough data.\n",
    " - The prior on a parameter you care about (does it appear in your paper's abstract?) should usually summarize previous measurements, assuming that you trust them but you are doing a better experiment. In this case, your likelihood measures the information provided by your data alone, and the posterior provides the new \"world average\".\n",
    " - The prior on a **nuisance parameter** (which you need for technical reasons but are not interesting in measuring) should be set conservatively (restrict as little as possible, to minimize the influence on the posterior) and in different ways (compare posteriors with different priors to estimate systematic uncertainty).\n",
    " - If you really have no information on which to base a prior, learn about [uninformative priors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability#Uninformative_priors), but don't be fooled by their apparent objectivity.\n",
    " - If being able to calculate your evidence integral analytically is especially important, look into [conjugate priors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior), but don't be surprised if this forces you to adopt an oversimplified model. The binomial example above is one of the rare cases where this works out. \n",
    " - Always state your priors (in your code, papers, talks, etc), even when they don't matter much."

    "We started above with the Bayesian joint probability:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(D, \\Theta_M, M)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "When the individual data features, parameters and hyperparameters are all written out, this often ends up being a very high-dimensional function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most general case, the joint probability requires a huge volume of data to estimate (recall our earlier discussion of [dimensionality reduction](Dimensionality.ipynb)). However, many problems can be (approximately) described by a joint probability that is simplified by assuming that some random variables are mutually independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Graphical models are a convenient visualization of the assumed direct dependencies between random variables. For example, suppose we have two parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ and no hyperparameters, then the joint probability $P(D, \\alpha, \\beta)$ can be expanded into a product of conditionals different ways using the rules of probability calculus, e.g.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(D, \\alpha, \\beta) = P(D,\\beta\\mid \\alpha)\\, P(\\alpha) = P(D\\mid \\alpha,\\beta)\\, P(\\beta\\mid \\alpha)\\, P(\\alpha) \\; .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "or, equally well as,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(D, \\alpha, \\beta) = P(D,\\alpha\\mid \\beta)\\, P(\\beta) = P(D\\mid \\alpha,\\beta)\\, P(\\alpha\\mid \\beta)\\, P(\\beta) \\; ,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The corresponding diagrams are:\n",
    "![Fully connected 1](img/Bayes/fully_connected_1.png)\n",
    "![Fully connected 2](img/Bayes/fully_connected_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to read these diagrams is that a node labeled with $X$ represents a (multiplicative) factor $P(X\\mid\\ldots)$ in the joint probability, where $\\ldots$ lists other nodes whose arrows feed into this node (in any order, thanks to probability calculus Rule-1). A shaded node indicates a random variable that is directly observed (i.e., data) while non-shaded nodes represent (unobserved) latent random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "These diagrams both describe a fully general joint probability with two parameters. The rules for building a fully general joint probability with any number of parameters are:\n",
    " - Pick an (arbitrary) ordering of the parameters.\n",
    " - The first parameter's node has arrows pointing to all other nodes (including the data).\n",
    " - The n-th parameter's node has arrows pointing to all later parameter nodes and the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "With $n$ parameters, there are then $n!$ possible diagrams and the number of potential dependencies grows rapidly with $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate this factorial growth, we seek pairs of random variables that should not depend on each other. For example, in the two parameter case:\n",
    "![Partial 1](img/Bayes/partial_1.png)\n",
    "![Partial 2](img/Bayes/partial_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how each diagram tells a different story. For example, the first diagram tells us that the data can be predicted knowing only $\\beta$, but that our prior knowledge of $\\beta$ depends on $\\alpha$. In effect, then, simplifying a joint probability involves drawing a diagram that tells a suitable story for your data and models."
